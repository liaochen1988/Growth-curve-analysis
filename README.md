# Growth-curve-analysis
A new method to analyze growth curve is offered based on croissance (https://pypi.org/project/croissance/). Croissance extracts all possible growth phases by defining a growth phase as a time period that its growth rate is above zero and increasing. Then they fit an exponential model to each phase identified. However, a growing phase may be partially exponential but may not be exponential over the entire range. So fitting an exponential model to the entire range of data results in errors when estimating growth rate and lag time.

What we do is taking the phases identified by croissance and fit the local curve using an exponential model with offset. The constant offset can help describe regions where biomass grows very slowly and linearly. We extract growth rate and lag time (the time exponential growth starts) from the fitting. However, the lag time may fall outside of the growth phase. If it is before the start of the phase, it means that the phase is exponential from the beginning and we set the start time as the time when exponential growth starts (it should be earlier than the start time though). If it is later than the end of the phase, it means that the growth phase is not enterinig into exponential phase and will probably enter it later. We are interested in the growth rate of the first growth phase when its lag time falls between the start and end of the phase.
