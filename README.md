# Growth-curve-analysis
A new method to analyze growth curve is offered based on croissance (https://pypi.org/project/croissance/). Croissance extracts all possible growth phases by defining a growth phase as a time period that its growth rate is above zero and increasing. Then they fit an exponential model to each phase identified. However, a growing phase may be partially exponential but may not be exponential over the entire range. So fitting an exponential model to the entire range of data results in errors when estimating growth rate and lag time.

What we do is taking the phases identified by croissance and fit the local curve using an exponential model with offset. The constant offset can help describe regions where biomass grows very slowly and linearly. If fitting fails (e.g., the estimated lag time is smaller than zero), we switch to an exponential model with offset strictly equal to zero and hope to describe only the trend but not any details. We tested the modified approach using growth curves of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two conditions.
