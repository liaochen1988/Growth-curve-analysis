# Growth-curve-analysis
A new method to analyze growth curve is given. The new method is based on croissance (https://pypi.org/project/croissance/) which extracts all growth phases (a growth phase is defined as a time period that its growth rate is above zero and increasing) and quantifies their characteristic parameters. Ideally, biomass remains constant in lag phase and only starts to grow from exponential phase. Under this perfect condition, a growth phase identified by croissance is an exponential phase.

However, the reality may deviate and a growth phase may include periods when biomass grows but not in an exponential way. In this case, croissance still tries to fit an exponential model. To overcome this difficulty, we change the exponential model to an exponential model with positive offset to describe local change of population growth for each phase identified by croissance. If multiple growth phases are found, we assume the exponential phase is the one with highest growth rate as long as its local lag time is positive. We tested the modified approach using growth curves of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
